                    <strong>Support and Resistance</strong>
                    <p>
                        You may be passionate about trading Forex, but that does not mean that jumping headfirst into
                        the trading will do
                        you any good.
                        Like all other professions, Forex needs training too.
                        A period of theoretical education followed by a period of apprenticeship is what makes traders
                        market ready.
                    </p>
                    <p>A support and resistance trading strategy involves buying at support and selling at resistance,
                        or vice versa.
                        The trader can use different indicators or signals to confirm the entry and exit points, such as
                        candlestick patterns, volume, oscillators, or breakouts.
                        The trader can also use stop-loss orders and take-profit orders to protect their positions and
                        lock in profits.</p>
                    <p>One of the advantages of support and resistance trading strategy is that it can work in any
                        market condition, whether it is trending or ranging.
                        Another advantage is that it can offer a favorable risk-reward ratio, as the trader can place
                        their stop-loss close to the support or resistance level, and target a larger profit margin.</p>
                    <h2>How to figure out levels of Resistance and Support?</h2>
                    <p>This is the most straightforward way of plotting support and resistance levels. Mark visible
                        highs and lows on your chart; the higher highs and lower highs will serve as resistance levels,
                        whereas the lower lows and higher lows will serve as support levels.
                        It is always recommended that these lines be marked on longer timeframes to have reliable
                        support and resistance levels.</p>
                    <p>Breakout Trading</p>
                    <p>Support and resistance levels do not hold the price hostage. That means they can be breached.
                        Prices usually breakout after a prolonged period of consolidation, and this offers traders a
                        great deal of opportunity. A breakout is usually the start of a new trend, which means traders
                        have an opportunity to ride out an entire trend from its very beginning. When the price breaches
                        a support line, it implies that a downtrend is now in place and traders should look to place
                        sell orders; whereas a resistance line breach implies an uptrend is in place, and traders should
                        look to place buy orders.

                    Education is essential in trading.
                    Traders should always be learning and improving their skills. The market is constantly changing, and
                    traders must
                    adapt to those changes.
                    The more traders learn, the more they can refine their trading strategies and take advantage of
                    them.
                    </p>
                    <strong>Breakout Strategy</strong>
                    <p>This strategy involves identifying a price level where the assetâ€™s price has been consolidating
                        for an extended period and then placing a trade when the price breaks out of that range.
                        This strategy is based on the assumption that once the price breaks out of the consolidation
                        range, it will continue to move in the same direction.</p>
                    <p>How to Trade Breakouts Using Trend Lines
                        When drawing trend lines, it is best if you can connect at least two tops or bottoms together.
                        The more tops or bottoms that connect, the stronger the trend line.
                        So how can you use trend lines to your advantage? When the price approaches your trend line,
                        only two things can happen.
                        1. The price could bounce off the trend line and continue the trend.
                        2. The price could break out through the trend line and cause a reversal.

                    Preparation is key to success in any field, and trading is no exception.
                    Traders must be willing to put in the time and effort to plan their trading day.
                    The ever-changing market conditions keep even top traders on their toes and push them to prepare
                    carefully before
                    placing an order.
                    </p>
                    <strong>Moving Average Crossover Strategy</strong>
                    <p>This strategy involves using two moving averages of different periods to identify the trend. When
                        the shorter-term moving average crosses above the longer-term moving average, it is considered a
                        bullish signal, and traders may look to buy.
                        Conversely, when the shorter-term moving average crosses below the longer-term moving average,
                        it is considered a bearish signal, and traders may look to sell.</p>
                    <p>How do you find the moving average crossover?</p>
                    <p>All you must do is plop on a couple of moving averages on your chart and wait for a crossover. If
                        the moving averages cross over one another, it could signal that the trend is about to change
                        soon, thereby giving you the chance to get a better entry. By having a better entry, you have
                        the chance to bag more pips!

                    <strong>Carry Trade Strategy</strong>
                    <p>This strategy involves borrowing in a low-interest-rate currency and investing in a
                        high-interest-rate currency. The idea is to profit from the interest rate differential between
                        the two currencies.
                        This strategy is best suited for traders who have a long-term outlook and are willing to hold
                        positions for an extended period.</p>
                    <p>Practical Example</p>
                    <p>Say, for example, a trader notices that the rate of the Japanese yen is 0.5%, while the rate of
                        the Australian dollar is 4%. The trader aims to make a profit of up to 3.5%, which is the
                        difference between the two rates. He will then carry an FX carry trade by borrowing Japanese yen
                        and converting it into Australian dollars. The trader will then invest the dollars into a
                        security that pays the AUD rate.
                        After the maturity of the investment, the trader will then reconvert the investment proceeds
                        back to the Japanese yen, with the intention of making some risk-free profit by using the
                        interest rate spread between the two currencies. If the exchange rate moves against the yen, the
                        trader will profit even more. However, if the yen got stronger, the trader would have earned
                        less than the 3.5% interest spread or might have even incurred a loss.
