                    <summary>How Does Forex Compare to Other Markets?</summary>
                    <p>Unlike stocks, futures, or options, currency trading does not take place on a regulated exchange,
                        and it is not controlled by any central governing body. There are no clearing houses to
                        guarantee trades, and there is no arbitration panel to adjudicate disputes. All members trade
                        with each other based on credit agreements. Essentially, business in the largest, most liquid
                        market in the world depends on nothing more than a metaphorical handshake. At first glance, this
                        ad-hoc arrangement is bewildering to investors who are used to structured exchanges such as the
                        New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) or the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME). However, this
                        arrangement works in practice.
                        Self-regulation provides effective control over the market because participants in FX must both
                        compete and cooperate.</p>

                    <summary>What is Forex?</summary>
                    <p>Forex, also known as foreign exchange or FX trading, is the conversion of one currency into
                        another.
                        It is one of the most actively traded markets in the world, with an average daily trading volume
                        of $6.6 trillion.</p>

                    <summary>What are the Risks of Forex Trading? </summary>
                    <p> Forex trading involves a high degree of risk. The market is highly volatile, and prices can
                        change rapidly in response to news events or other factors. Traders can lose money if they do
                        not have a solid understanding of the market, or if they do not manage their risk properly. It
                        is important to have a trading plan in place and to stick to it.
                        Traders should also use stop-loss orders to limit their losses if the market moves against them.
