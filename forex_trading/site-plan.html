        What is Forex Trading?
      </p>
      <p>
        The foreign exchange market is an international, decentralized, over-the-counter platform where currencies can be traded. 
        The foreign exchange rates for each currency are set by this market. 
        It covers every facet of purchasing, selling, and converting currencies at established or current rates.

      <h3>Education</h3>
      <p>
        You may be passionate about trading Forex, but that does not mean that jumping headfirst into the trading will do you any good. 
        Like all other professions, Forex needs training too. 
        A period of theoretical education followed by a period of apprenticeship is what makes traders market ready.
      </p>
      <p>
        Education is essential in trading. 
        Traders should always be learning and improving their skills. The market is constantly changing, and traders must adapt to those changes. 
        The more traders learn, the more they can refine their trading strategies and take advantage of them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Preparation is key to success in any field, and trading is no exception. 
        Traders must be willing to put in the time and effort to plan their trading day. 
        The ever-changing market conditions keep even top traders on their toes and push them to prepare carefully before placing an order.
