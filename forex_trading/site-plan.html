    <h3>Education</h3>
    <p>
      You may be passionate about trading Forex, but that does not mean that jumping headfirst into the trading will do
      you any good.
      Like all other professions, Forex needs training too.
      A period of theoretical education followed by a period of apprenticeship is what makes traders market ready.
    </p>
    <p>
      Education is essential in trading.
      Traders should always be learning and improving their skills. The market is constantly changing, and traders must
      adapt to those changes.
      The more traders learn, the more they can refine their trading strategies and take advantage of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Preparation is key to success in any field, and trading is no exception.
      Traders must be willing to put in the time and effort to plan their trading day.
      The ever-changing market conditions keep even top traders on their toes and push them to prepare carefully before
      placing an order.
    </p>
    <p>A support and resistance trading strategy involves buying at support and selling at resistance,
      or vice versa.
      The trader can use different indicators or signals to confirm the entry and exit points, such as
      candlestick patterns, volume, oscillators, or breakouts.
      The trader can also use stop-loss orders and take-profit orders to protect their positions and
      lock in profits.</p>
    <p>One of the advantages of support and resistance trading strategy is that it can work in any
      market condition, whether it is trending or ranging.
      Another advantage is that it can offer a favorable risk-reward ratio, as the trader can place
      their stop-loss close to the support or resistance level, and target a larger profit margin.</p>
    <h2>How to figure out levels of Resistance and Support?</h2>
    <p>This is the most straightforward way of plotting support and resistance levels. Mark visible
      highs and lows on your chart; the higher highs and lower highs will serve as resistance levels,
      whereas the lower lows and higher lows will serve as support levels.
      It is always recommended that these lines be marked on longer timeframes to have reliable
      support and resistance levels.</p>
    <p>Breakout Trading</p>
    <p>Support and resistance levels do not hold the price hostage. That means they can be breached.
      Prices usually breakout after a prolonged period of consolidation, and this offers traders a
      great deal of opportunity. A breakout is usually the start of a new trend, which means traders
      have an opportunity to ride out an entire trend from its very beginning. When the price breaches
      a support line, it implies that a downtrend is now in place and traders should look to place
      sell orders; whereas a resistance line breach implies an uptrend is in place, and traders should
      look to place buy orders.
    </p>
    <p>This strategy involves identifying a price level where the assetâ€™s price has been consolidating
      for an extended period and then placing a trade when the price breaks out of that range.
      This strategy is based on the assumption that once the price breaks out of the consolidation
      range, it will continue to move in the same direction.</p>
    <p>How to Trade Breakouts Using Trend Lines
      When drawing trend lines, it is best if you can connect at least two tops or bottoms together.
      The more tops or bottoms that connect, the stronger the trend line.
      So how can you use trend lines to your advantage? When the price approaches your trend line,
      only two things can happen.
      1. The price could bounce off the trend line and continue the trend.
      2. The price could break out through the trend line and cause a reversal.
    </p>
    <p>This strategy involves using two moving averages of different periods to identify the trend. When
      the shorter-term moving average crosses above the longer-term moving average, it is considered a
      bullish signal, and traders may look to buy.
      Conversely, when the shorter-term moving average crosses below the longer-term moving average,
      it is considered a bearish signal, and traders may look to sell.</p>
    <p>How do you find the moving average crossover?</p>
    <p>All you must do is plop on a couple of moving averages on your chart and wait for a crossover. If
      the moving averages cross over one another, it could signal that the trend is about to change
      soon, thereby giving you the chance to get a better entry. By having a better entry, you have
      the chance to bag more pips!
    </p>
    <p>This strategy involves borrowing in a low-interest-rate currency and investing in a
      high-interest-rate currency. The idea is to profit from the interest rate differential between
      the two currencies.
      This strategy is best suited for traders who have a long-term outlook and are willing to hold
      positions for an extended period.</p>
    <p>Practical Example</p>
    <p>Say, for example, a trader notices that the rate of the Japanese yen is 0.5%, while the rate of
      the Australian dollar is 4%. The trader aims to make a profit of up to 3.5%, which is the
      difference between the two rates. He will then carry an FX carry trade by borrowing Japanese yen
      and converting it into Australian dollars. The trader will then invest the dollars into a
      security that pays the AUD rate.
      After the maturity of the investment, the trader will then reconvert the investment proceeds
      back to the Japanese yen, with the intention of making some risk-free profit by using the
      interest rate spread between the two currencies. If the exchange rate moves against the yen, the
      trader will profit even more. However, if the yen got stronger, the trader would have earned
      less than the 3.5% interest spread or might have even incurred a loss.

    <h3>FAQ</h3>
    <p>
      It is good to know more about what we do here and you're free to ask questions.
    </p>
    <p>Unlike stocks, futures, or options, currency trading does not take place on a regulated exchange, and it is not
      controlled by any central governing body. There are no clearing houses to guarantee trades, and there is no
      arbitration panel to adjudicate disputes. All members trade with each other based on credit agreements.
      Essentially, business in the largest, most liquid market in the world depends on nothing more than a metaphorical
      handshake. At first glance, this ad-hoc arrangement is bewildering to investors who are used to structured
      exchanges such as the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) or the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME). However, this
      arrangement works in practice.
      Self-regulation provides effective control over the market because participants in FX must both compete and
      cooperate.</p>
    <p>Forex, also known as foreign exchange or FX trading, is the conversion of one currency into another.
      It is one of the most actively traded markets in the world, with an average daily trading volume of $6.6 trillion.
    </p>
    <p>Forex traders make money by buying and selling currencies.
      They profit from the difference between the buying and selling price of a currency pair.
      This difference is known as the spread. Forex traders can also make money by speculating on the direction of
      currency prices.
      If they believe that a currency will appreciate in value, they can buy it.
      If they believe that a currency will depreciate in value, they can sell it.</p>
    <p> Forex trading involves a high degree of risk. The market is highly volatile, and prices can change rapidly in
      response to news events or other factors. Traders can lose money if they do not have a solid understanding of the
      market, or if they do not manage their risk properly. It is important to have a trading plan in place and to stick
      to it.
      Traders should also use stop-loss orders to limit their losses if the market moves against them.</p>
